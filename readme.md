# RMF Reservations

This is a library that provides resource optimization constraints for multi-robot applications. More specifcally,
we provide a very simple formulation for resource optimization and scheduling. A robot may request the use of a
resource like a charger for a fixed duration of time within a given time range. The system will then assign the robot
to said resource.

This is the type of resource constraint scheduling that this library can solve:
```
Robot1 Charging Request:

Alternatives:
    - Charger 1
        - Start Time Range From:10:00 to 11:00
        - Duration 1 hour
        - Cost: My own cost function
    - Charger 2
        - Start Time Range From:10:00 to 12:00
        - Duration 1 hour
        - Cost: My own cost function

Robot2 Charging Request:

Alternatives:
    - Charger 2
        - Start Time Range From:10:00 to 11:00
        - Duration 1 hour
        - Cost: My own cost function
    - Charger 3
        - Start Time Range From:10:00 to 13:00
        - Duration 1 hour
        - Cost: My own cost function
```

The requests can come in asynchronously. We can solve both optimally and suboptimally depoending on the complexity of the problem.

A variety of algorithms have been implmented in this library including SAT based algorithms and greedy algorithms.
