// The goal of this example is to demonstrate fire safety
// Each robot has a seperate hypothetical spot in a single story
// warehouse. In the backend an optimizer runs giving 
// the best possible assignment to each robot.
// We compare performance between
// with Conflict-based-search in the loop and
// without conflict based search in the loop.
// This uses the trivial heuristic of dijkstra to 
// the nearest point in the graph.
